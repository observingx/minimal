Event Date: MCAT 20 Jul 2019

I re-took my MCAT on 7/20/2019 because I subscribed to the idea that my original score was low to get into any medical school. What I failed to consider was that it was the opinion of neurotic pre-meds online. I also failed to account that it was a bell curve, and that I was comparing my 506 at the absolute average without considering other part of my application like history or extracurricular activities. 

Lessons learned: 

* Are you subscribing to other people's perception of what is a solid MCAT score? If so, for whose overall application? How much did your emotions influence this perception?
* When you had the opportunity to un-score the test, did you make a decision objectively or with emotions?
