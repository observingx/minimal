It's been 4 weeks since I arrived to Texas. There were so many things that occurred, that I'll have to section it into chapters:

# 3-day Travel from California to Texas

I'm so glad I swung by my former college roommate's place in Arizona. I did not know how much he cared for me. He was definitely ecstatic to see me, took me to his place, and showed me around town. When I left to continue on with my journey, he texted me that I was "family." What's most bizaarre was that I too did not know that he was like family to me as well. Love that guy like a bro. 

It was funny when he showed that he kept the bowls and glasses that I bought when we were still living together, and now those are still with him in Arizona. He even kept the username/password that I created from when we were living together.

Though we only lived together for a year, it was meaningful enough that it transcends time and space. I've always had good feelings about him from the very time I met him in our class in Texas. Then, I ran into him at the gym while doing bouldering. Left him because I needed to move for an internship. I've always felt that he's always been proud of me and how he would elevate me when around his other friends because I've worked for a big movie company at one point.
