It's Friday the 13th!

I'm referring to that person as "person" because I've always seen them as a person first and not by gender, race, or age. 

That person snapped at me a few minutes after hearing me tell my instructor athat I start medical school in 4 months. They snapped. They felt I was referring to them as "idiot" during our conversation ten minutes prior.

To back track, they handed me a pair of parietal bones in the Anatomy Class. I took the bones from them and handed them to the instructor and told him, "these are supposedly right." They (that person) gave me snide remarks about using the word "supposedly." It didn't occur to me at that time that the person was offended. Yes, they were offended for using the word "supposedly." Looking back, the only clue that I should have took note that they were offended was when they said, "Oh, a racist and a sexist."

So after the talk I had with my professor where I inquired about medical school, they snapped at me. They kept saying that they're tired being referred to as an "idiot" or "dumb," and that they have a Bachelor's and Master's degrees. I autoomatically took more an apologetic stance stating that I was sorry that they felt that way and that I did not mean for it to come that way. (In hindsight, this seem to be my predisposed initial stance and I should have been aware to not succumb.)

Then, when I was about to leave, I compounded my mistake by trying to be friendly with them and introducing my name. After I introduced myself to make peace, they literally said, "I am not dumb." It was at this moment when I started to regret talking to them at all after we've said our amends the first time. It seemed that they were close minded and was set that there was never a misunderstanding. They even lectured me how I would have nurses. Anyway, we bode each other farewell. I couldn't care less how it ended, I just wanted no more of my time spent around that person. 


Lessons learned: 

* After saying your amends, let it simmer and not make contact.
* Mirror instead of taking apologetic stance. 
* Be more confident and less vague. I use "supposedly" to indicate my lack of knowledge; they felt it was lack of trust.
* Be charming in everyday language.
