Dude, you've always known you would want to see a face first. You've always known you're into kissing? Why not be honest with yourself and save yourself some time, energy, and dignity?

Did you not address those information because you're afraid that the other person might reject you? Furthermore, once you saw the guy in-person, you weren't really into him, so you could fault yourself for compromising what you value.

Dude, for the life of you, enumerate what you value in a hookup (you can deal with relationship later):

* face and body — if online, face pics are a must
* into kissing, nip play, and someone who bottoms
* douched
* clean (STI and drugs)
* ill/sick (COVID, flu, fever, cough, etc.)
* demeanor — this is addressed in-person only (the rest before meeting up)


As a refresher of this incident, you met up with this guy without exchanging face photos. Secondly, you still met up with this person knowing he did not kiss (he was clear about this). Thirdly, the moment you saw him, your attraction towards him was on the low end (middle at best) if there was a spectrum. Fourthly, you failed to ask if he douched.


Thus, to help you for your next hookup, please refer to the list above. Bookmark it!
