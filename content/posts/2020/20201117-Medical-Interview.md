Melinda said to remember

* Look them in the eyes
* Acknowledge whenever they tell you something. They're sharing it to you. (e.g., Thank you for sharing that, I'm sorry to hear that, That must be really hard, etd...)

### 0: Intrapersonal

The patient will feel comfortable when you exude confidence.

• Speak clear with a follow through!

• Your face shows your mindset. Smile when people are happy; empathize with your face, when it’s a sad moment.

• Open/ended questions let them speak for themselves and avoid interrogation.

  

### 1: Set the stage and agenda

Hello! (heh·low) My name is (/iz/) {Name here}. I’m a medical (meh·duh·kl) student (stoo·dnt) working for Dr. {Last Name}. May I get your full name pls? **And what name do you go by?**

Nice to meet you John. I’ll be taking some medical notes for your visit today.
  

Have you done video (vi·dee·ow) {pronounced like the i in chip or lit} tele-mediciine in the past?

-   Alright. Just to keep you informed, this call is confidential, and I’m in a private room. Are you in an area where you are comfortable discussing personal information that may pertain to your health?
    

-   Great!
    

-   Also, I’ll also be typing notes throughout our conversation, so you might hear some typing noises and notice my gaze change as I type. Just so you know, I’m doing them to ensure we get accurate data of your condition. If they do become a distraction for you, do let me know, so I can minimize the distraction.
    

  

**What brought you here today?** (chief concern)

-   Sorry to hear you’re having that. Am glad you reached out to us today, so we can help you manage that.
    

  

But before we dive into that, is there anything else you want us to discuss today?

-   Great! We will spend the next 20 minutes together discussing that.
    

  

Alright. Now, what would be helpful is if you take me back to the very beginning and kind of bring me up to now.

### 2: HPI

Begin the interview with non focusing skills that help the patient to express her/himself.
- Use non focusing open-ended skills (attentive listening): silence, continuers, nonverbal encouragement
- Obtain additional data from nonverbal sources: nonverbal cues, physical characteristics, autonomic changes, accoutrements, environment, and self

Use  focusing skills to learn 3 things: symptom story, personal context, and emotional context
- Echoes (repeat the patient's words, e.g., “excruciating pain?”)
- Requests (“That sounds important; can you say more about it?”)
- Summaries (“First you had a fever, then 2 days later your knee began to hurt, and yesterday you began to limp.”)

Elicit/develop emotional context
- Use emotion-seeking skills:
    - Direct: “How are you doing with this?” “How does this make you feel?” “How has this affected you, emotionally?”
    - Indirect: Impact (e.g., “How has this affected your day-to-day life?” “What has your knee pain been like for your family?”); Beliefs about the problem (e.g., “What do you think might be causing your knee pain?”); Intuit how the patient might be feeling (e.g., “I think I might be frustrated if that happened to me,” “I can imagine that this might be worrying for you.”); Triggers (e.g., “What made you decide to come in now for your …?” “What else is going on in your life?”)

  

#### The 7 Cardinal Features are:

-   Onset and Chronology: When did it start? What's happened over time? Constant or intermittent? Course of symptoms?
    - **How long does the pain/symptom last?**
    -  **How often do they occur?**
    - **Have you had this in the past?**
-   Position and radiation: Define the area/areas - deep or superficial, localized or diffuse?    
-   Quality: Usual or unusual descriptors. **How would you describe the pain?** (dull, sharp, waxing and waning, etc.?)    
-   Quantification: Type of onset, intensity/severity, impairment/disability, numeric description (number of events, size, volume)    
-   Setting (Context): **What setting or circumstance contributes to the symptom?**
    - (circumstances that contribute to or precipitate the symptom)
    - a. Environmental factors
    - b. Social factors
    - c. Activity
    - d. Emotions
-   Transforming factors: What brought this on or aggravates it? What makes it better?
-   Related symptoms: Any other associated symptoms?
    

  

AKA:

-   Chronology
-   Context — (obtained through lawn mowing?)
-   Location/radiation
-   quality
-   quantity
-   ↑↓
-   Associated Manifestations
    
  
Overall: 
- Impact (job, hobbies, ADL’s, relationships) and Worries:
    -  **How does this impact your life? What worries and concerns do you have?**
    -  **What do you want most out of this?**
- Hypothesis testing
- Summarize the HPI.

  

### 3. Health History

Transition to middle of the interview (clinician-centered phase)

Now we transition our discussion to your health history. Some of the questions might be awkward, like topics about sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll, but rest assured everything’s confidential and what we want is transparency. The more transparent you are, the better, so we can obtain a complete picture to help with your diagnosis. If the question becomes too uncomfortable, let me know and I’ll find a better way to phrase it or perhaps skip it. And I’ll even explain why we want it.

  

Past Medical History:

-   What other medical (meh·duh·kl) history do you have?
   -   HTN, HLD, DM: Hypertension, Diabetes, Hyperlipidemia
-  Any past hospitalization?

Allergies to medication:
-   Have you had an allergic reaction to any medicine? What were they?
-    What allergic reaction do you have to any medicine?  

Medication History:

Family History:

Social History:

    -   Occupation: What’s work like for you?
-   What’s your physical activity like?
    -   What’s your typical diet like on a regular day?

    -  How many sexual partners?
    -  What were their genders or sexual identities?
    -   Were you using protection or contraceptives?

### 4: ROS

Transition to ROS:

I'd like to switch gears now and ask you some questions to better understand your overall health. And these questions are typical yes or no questions, so I’ll be asking them at a faster pace. Do you have any questions before we begin?
