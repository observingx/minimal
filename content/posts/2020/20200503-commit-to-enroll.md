I officially activaated the "Commit to Enroll" button on my medical schol portal. It feels surreal. A year ago, I was a hopeful applicant with terrible MCAT. I'm so thankful I was given a chance to pursue the medical path and become a physician. All I need now is to just complete paperwork.

Great challenges and growth lie ahead!
