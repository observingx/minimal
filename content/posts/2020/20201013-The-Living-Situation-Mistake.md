## What went wrong? 

Well, I did not take the $700 duplex apartment that was a 5-minute walk to the Gym. Working out is important for me it seems. It really is.

I realized this mistake last Friday when I noticed someone was doing Olympic Weightlifting at the school gym,  and that the gym was a 5 minute walk to the apartment. Those 2 things should have been the best reasons to take the apartment. In addition, it was freaking $700, big living room, cental A/C, and next to Kroger.


I even made a [spreadsheet (see here)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQlX-mtoiDrle_2biZTmjylU7bEFGmKyhDKJl3pvIM8/edit#gid=0) to ensure I was comparing both properly. Looking at it now, making the spreadsheet was a good first-step, but I don't think I compared both well enough. Or it might have been a way to talk myself out of it because I'm already locked in at this temporary apartment I'm at thru December. Pennywise; poundfoolish.

## How did I truly feel the moment I went in?

Well, outside, it was niceâ€”a duplex! Inside, the living room was big. Though, the "old-house" scent was not the greatest. The bathroom was not too clean, so that was a slight red flag for me, and so was the kitchen. 

Nonetheless, I liked the location and the fact that it's a duplex. I remember walking out that it wold be nice to have my mail delivered here since my roommate from the state I lived in was still holding on to my mail. 

## What I should have done...


Well, a few questions that I failed to ask myself:

* What are the top 2 things that are most important to me? And how would I simplify things to achieve them? 

* Simplify, simplify, simplify. 

* If money was not a cost to you... would you try it?

* Can you buy some time to decide how you truly feel?

* Are the red flags superficial and correctable?

## How would I recover from this?

* **I have to acknowledge that I am hurt.** It stings. I feel like I lost something that was gold. It was the perfect spot for the perfect price (knowing from back knowledge that you can't really find a $800 1-bedroom apartment).


* **Understand what's important to me.** And to me, the 2 most important things are being able to go to the gym by walking, and being able to have quality study time. Sure, I missed out on getting that "golden spot", but I can still achieve these goals from a different spot.
