## What went wrong? 

Well, I did not take the $700 duplex apartment that was a 5-minute walk to the Gym. Working out is important for me it seems. It really is.

I realized this mistake last Friday when I noticed someone was doing Olympic Weightlifting at the school gym,  and that the gym was a 5 minute walk to the apartment. Those 2 things should have been the best reasons to take the apartment. In addition, it was freaking $700, big living room, cental A/C, and next to Kroger.


I even made a [spreadsheet (see here)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQlX-mtoiDrle_2biZTmjylU7bEFGmKyhDKJl3pvIM8/edit#gid=0) to ensure I was comparing both properly. Looking at it now, making the spreadsheet was a good first-step, but I don't think I compared both well enough. Or it might have been a way to talk myself out of it because I'm already locked in at this temporary apartment I'm at thru December. Pennywise; poundfoolish.

## How did I truly feel the moment I went in?

Well, outside, it was nice—a duplex! Inside, the living room was big. Though, the "old-house" scent was not the greatest. The bathroom was not too clean, so that was a slight red flag for me, and so was the kitchen. 

Nonetheless, I liked the location and the fact that it's a duplex. I remember walking out that it wold be nice to have my mail delivered here since my roommate from the state I lived in was still holding on to my mail. 

## What I should have done...


Well, a few questions that I failed to ask myself:

* What are the top 2 things that are most important to me? And how would I simplify things to achieve them? — Simplify, simplify, simplify. 

* If money was not a cost to you... would you try it?

* Can you buy more time to do research and understand how you truly feel? Especially if you don't know the market in that area. 

* Are the red flags superficial and correctable?


* If both decisions were mistakes, which mistake would I regret more? 

* Do you want it? Will it make you happier? Can you afford it?

*  The demeanor of the "seller" (current tenant who's looking to transfer the lease) also affected me. It felt like he was pitting me against the other applicants, and I felt pressured. 

## Was the Bronze room for rent also a mistake?

I made mistakes and they included:

* Not doing my homework about the area prior to moving. Sure, I was in a different state, but I still could have done some prework. (See next topic)

## Prework when moving to any new place:


* Comfort is NUMERO UNO! Ask yourself: how comfortable are you staying here 72 hours straight?

* **Location, location, location.** Pick an area you want to live in, and ask yourself key questions (e.g., why do you want to live in this area, how important is it for you, etc.)

* **Know the area.** Get an understanding of rental prices in the area  and nearby areas you want to live in. This can be done through Zillow, Craigslist, or even utilizing local realtors.

* **Zooming in on the house.** Get the technical aspects of the house: cost, square footage (size), contract length, electric bill cost, water bill, gas bill, internet. 

* **Get a "Second Look", always.** It's difficult to see and digest everything in a 20 minute visit the first time around.

* **When moving from out of town, plan in phases/chunks.** For example, if moving from California to Texas, do not expect to find a new apartment in the first week. You're already physically and mentally exhausted from the travel. Hence, haul yourself first somewhere close to the new city (phase 1) and stay at a short-term apartment for 2-3 months. Idealy, this temporary place caters to your needs (e.g., gym, comfort, etc.) Then, ocassionally travel to the location you'd like to live at and get to know the area (cost, traffic, walk by it, etc.) while living nearby (phase 2).  Hence, moving from out of town to a new city should be more like a 2-3 month process.

* **Expect some seller influence.*** How much would you be affected by the seller in making your decision? (e.g., too sweet, pressures you, put you in competition, etc.)

* **Rehearse on how to buy more time.**  Expect yourself to buy more time. A decision made on the spot (whether through pressure, out of haste, being put on the spot) is a decision not reflected on. Let it sink in first. You will not be pressured!


  

## How would I recover from this?

* **I have to acknowledge that I am hurt.** It stings. I feel like I lost something that was gold. It was the perfect spot for the perfect price (knowing from back knowledge that you can't really find a $800 1-bedroom apartment).


* **Understand what's important to me.** And to me, the 2 most important things are being able to go to the gym by walking, and being able to have quality study time. Sure, I missed out on getting that "golden spot", but I can still achieve these goals from a different spot.
