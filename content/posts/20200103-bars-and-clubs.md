Looking back, why did I seek out going to bars/clubs back then at one point? (and maybe still now?)


In my early years here in Los Angeles, I remember going to bars and clubs. Why did I seek them out? The thrill of finding someone who's into me? The excitement of finding someone who finds me attractive and me attracted back? That age old love story? 

So I guess, I would go there to find someone who would appreciate me? Wasn't that too simple? Or was there more to it? 

In the end, I wanted acceptance, appreciation, and love from another person. Getting attention definitely indicates that there's some appreciation, acceptance, and even attraction. Love is the one that is the most difficult to get.
