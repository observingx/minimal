I was automatically polite towards a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyoneâ€”especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt. There was no attraction, I was not into the person. I should not sacrifice my well-being and putting myself into an uncomfortable position just because they're going to have a grad school healthcare interview the next day. Be honest with yourself! It will sting, but it's like plucking a thorn where it will feel good after the initial sting. 

In order to cope with this yucky feeling of betraying myself, I played online chess for 5 straight hours that night when I got home. I just wanted to forget whatever happened that night. 

What I could have done differently next time:

* Be honest with yourself.
* Honestly describe your emotions: no attraction, did not want to be there naked
* Honestly describe the conflict, if any: Saving yourself from a sex you did not want to be part of VS. Making yourself not look like an asshole (was the latter really a win?)

Lessons to Practice:

* Know thyself: When meeting a **stranger**, your predisposition has always been to be polite (to the point of sacrificing yourself) in favor of not causing unhappines to  that stranger. 
* What should you do? -- **Communicate.** A simple statement to verbally communicate how you feel is enough to do the job: "Imma be honest. I'm not feeling it. Thank you for the time."
