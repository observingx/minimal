It finally arrived! The phone call acceptance I've been longing for! I admit, the past 24 hours leading to that phone call was anxiety-inducing. Would I get the call at all? A rejection email perhaps? I  even told myself I would be happy if I would be put on hold; anything but a rejection!

I noticed a missed call from a private number. I knew that had to be them. Nonetheless, my anxiety increased. Delina, one of the students I was tutoring that afternoon, said, "You look sad." She was right. Realizing I just missed the call that could change my life was anything but happiness.

About half an hour or so later, my phone rang and it was from a private number agin. I knew it was that school! The phone call I was waiting for! I was so happy. Felt that my years of hard work in becoming a quality applicant was finally validated. That's how it felt. The weak parts of my application now felt vindicated. 

After receiving the call,  I texted  my siblings and close friends to tell them the great news. I only needed one acceptance, and I was glad it was this school (thus far). It is one of the top 3 schools on my list. There are  two other schools that could easily top this school because mainly for that sweet in-state tuition, brand, and location.Â
