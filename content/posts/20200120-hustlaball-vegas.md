Party/Event Rule: Only go to an event for one's self (If you can't have fun alone, it's a bad sign). @Hustlaball Las Vegas.

I had the option of going to Las Vegas for Hustlaball ($65) or staying in Los Angeles for a free Masterbeat Circuit Party (because of my 2019 purchase). Unfortunately, I chose the former. My reason—well, I thought Hustlaball was "the event" where everyone was gonna be at (Wow! I can't believe I just said that right now!). If I were to be honest with myself, I really went there because that was "where everyone was gonna be." 

And I think that was a mistake. One should go to an even for one's self, like to have a good time regardless of whomever else is in attendance. Much like going to the gym, one goes there for one's own sake and not because to be part of a conglomerate, to be loved/liked, or to be given attention to. I personally go to the gym and have fun even if it was just me. 


Thus, I took a bus ride at 5PM on a Sunday night from LA, arrived in Vegas at 10:30PM in time for the party, and I left Las Vegas at 5AM Monday morning. Hindsight is 20/20, and I admit this was a sub-par experience.

On a different note, I was lucky enough that the drivers of my bus rides let me in without  a ticket because I could not purchase them online. And I definitnely tried to sleep on the 5 hour bus ride from Vegas to LA. 

What would have made Hustlaball over Masterbeat a good decision?

* If I was in Vegas already, it would have made sense for Hustlaball.
* If I knew what kind of attendees were there, it would have made sense to not go there.

You see, Hustlaball Las Vegas was like a hybrid between a bathhouse and  a circuit party. However, its circuit party atmosphere was 5x worse than a regular circuit party (bad sound system and bad dance floor for starters, after all, they made a club out of a hotel's dining area), but its bathhouse atmosphere is 2x better than regular bathhouses. Then, there's a sprinkle of hired porn actors to be go-go dancers or perhaps to get hanky-panky with the customers. 
As you may know, a bathhouse has all sorts of guys wherein more than 90% of guys I  wouldn't dare touch, especially if the lights on. Same thing was the case at this Hustlaball Vegas. 

To make things worse, more than a third of attendees/customers were clothed older men. Since I was wearing nothing but a swimsuit, it definitely felt like it was a one-way observation from those who were clothed. At a circuit party, everyone was shirtless. 

It was also easy to be mesmerized by porn actors. Remember the psychology principle on familiarity and attraction: "Studies have shown that we are attracted to what is familiar to us, and that repeated exposure to certain people will increase our attraction toward them." It was in play here with the hired porn actor. When you see a familiar porn star face, you easily gravitate towards them.

Lesson learned:

* **Party/Event Rule:** Only go to an event for one's self. If you can't have fun alone, don't go. Much like going to the gym, you go there for your own sake. Not because to be part of a conglomerate, to be loved/liked, or to be given attention to. You go there and have fun even if it was just you by yourself.
* And if there are multiple events, compare their logistics (energy expenditure, cost, distance, expected kinds of attendees).
