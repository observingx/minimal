After my first couple of weeks of classes, there are several lessons learned that will prove effective for me in the long run...

I. The Power of Mindset

[Change your mindset, change the game](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0tqq66zwa7g) by Dr. Alia Crum
  * Mindset about Exercise
  * About diet
  * About stress
  * Aboud medication

Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset:
  * Carol Dweck's [Mindset The New Psychology of Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4PHa6w3Rto)

II. Forgetting Curve
---

Hermann Ebbinghaus hypothesized that the speed of forgetting depends on a number of factors such as the difficulty of the learned material (e.g. how meaningful it is), its representation and other physiological factors such as stress and sleep. He further hypothesized that the basal forgetting rate differs little between individuals. He concluded that the difference in performance can be explained by mnemonic representation skills.

He went on to hypothesize that basic training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome those differences in part. He asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:
 1. better memory representation (e.g. with mnemonic techniques)
 2. repetition based on active recall (especially spaced repetition).

  * ["If training is to drive behavior change, then it needs to stick inside the learner's brain. To make it sticky, it needs to be regularly reinforced."](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/what-is-the-forgetting-curve/)
  * ["A day or two after attending class or reading a chapter or article, students will have forgotten approximately 75% of what was learned. Moreover, most of that forgetting happens within the first hour."](https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/Writing%20Program/forgetting_curve.pdf)

IV. Connecting and Disconnecting (emotions)
---

Just how you were able to connect to a Medical Narrative, you can also disconnect from it to help you breathe.
