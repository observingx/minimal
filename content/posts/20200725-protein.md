![Peeing](/img/peeing.png)

I woke up today at 6:30AM realizing that I did not pee from the moment I slept since 10PM. The first thing I noted was that I did not have much to eat prior going to bed. My dinner last night comprised of a handful blueberries, a small yogurt, and an avocado. 

I also realized that at the start of the pandemic, there was about a week or so when I did not wake up to pee. I noted at that time that I lowered my protein intake as well because I was not working out due to gym closure throughout the state.

This makes me wonder: Have I been waking up nightly for the past 7 years because of high protein intake prior to bed?! Ugh! I think that makes perfect sense!  I think I'm about to make a trial-and-error adjustment on my protein intake.

What I need to know:

* How much protein does the body need per pound or gram of lean muscle?
* Adjust fat and protein accordingly.
* Time my meals, so that more protein is ingested during the day.

Current body weight: 150 lbs or 68 kg.

Protein intake target: 2 gram per kg body weight (2g/kg). Thus, ~136 g per day. I'll round it down to 130g. 

Fat intake: has to be higher.
