In romantic ventures, be honest to yourself about your emotions. Ask, "Am I attracted? What does myself need now?"
---

Are you even attracted to the person as a whole: looks and personality?  @Mad at Myself (again) during Holidays


This situation could have been solved several ways:

* Prevention by asking for face/body pics -- You gotta assess if there's attraction first before making any move.

* Prevention by buying time to assess and decide -- You can meet at a neutral place or go to the bathroom right away. You buy time to help you assess if there's attraction before furthering the move.


* Being honest with oneself  at any moment -- You gotta practice being honest with yourself at any moment and bail if you must, especially when there's not much time involved. 

In the end, whatever you **execute** has to put yourself in a **safe space**. You gotta be assertive without being offensive (ideally), but even if you offend the other party it's better for everyone because being romantic with someone has to be truthful.

Writing date: Monday, 23 Dec 2019 (Early Morning after I got home from that guy's place)

Edited: Sunday, 12 Jul 2020

I met up with Yaro(?) tonight: went straight to his apartment. He lives with other people, so we went to his room right away. I'm mad at myself because I went directly to his room, a very intimate confinement, without consulting myself to see if the standards I have have been checked off (this ensures in-person attraction). I should have met up with him at a common place first, and should have known what his personality was like or if I was attracted to him at all. Anyways, when we met, he did not look very much like his photos. The photos on his Grindr were not a very accurate representation of him. 

This has happened in the past too. The last time, I met up with a premed neighbor. I had an inkling that I was not into him, but I did not trust my instinct—this decision hurt me. Also, I should have asked for more face and body pics rather than meeting him after 2 pics. 

A similar incident in NYC happened too. When I met up with that "bi" Italian guy in NYC, the problem with that was 2 folds: (1) I did not ask for clear face pics, and (2) I was not candid from the start that I was not into him despite meeting up in a public space first. Though, I was hopeful he had a good body and waited till the winter jackets were off—maybe next time sit inside an even-temperature location where winter jackets would have to be removed?

Remember, it's okay to ask for more pics. It's okay to delay meeting up. It's okay to go to the restroom and think about things. It's NOT okay to do things out of social politeness.

Finally, I am mad at myself because I might have ruined my car a little tonight. I accidentally drove over an "island" on a regular road. It was like driving over a hump with decent speed. 

The moral of these stories are:
---

* Be Honest wth Yourself: your emotions, your needs.
* You do not have to break anyone's hearts, especially not your own. Hence, be honest with yourself and always convey the whole message: state what I observe, think, feel, and need.
