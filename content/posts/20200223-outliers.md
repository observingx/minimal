A book on why  certain people are successful.

<!--more-->

I finished reading  Malcolm Gladwell's Outlier book after a month (I took my time, reading about one chapter at a time). The overall takeaway message was that these people we see as "outliers," were not outliers at all. "They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain luckyâ€”but all critical to making them who are."

I tend to agree with Gladwell's message. I might be slightly biased because I've always erred on the side of "practice, practice, practice." The book points out age-old adaged like "10,000 hours rule" (as in the case of success for The Beatles, Mozart, Bill Gates), legacy (as in the case of Asian Math wizards with rice-paddy background instead of wheat, Korean pilots), being born at the right time/place (Bill Gates, NHL players), and more. 

One thing that was eye-opening for me was how airplane crashes was tied to the culture of the pilots. Gladwell looked at specific cases of a Korean airline and a Colombian airline. The not-so-direct and "mitigating" form of talking from those cultures were the main cause of these crashes. It was eye-opening for me because I never considered cultures of pilot when selecting my flights. From now on, it's something I'd take into account. 

As for the book's readability, the superficial presentation (e.g., font-size, book's thickness, etc.) allows it to be very readable for most ages, even those in high school. The book is an easy read and has vocabulary that is not too convoluted.
