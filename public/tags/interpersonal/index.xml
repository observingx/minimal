      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th!
I&amp;rsquo;m referring to that person as &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen them as a person first and not by gender, race, or age. That person snapped at me a few minutes after hearing me tell my instructor athat I start medical school in 4 months. They snapped. They felt I was referring to them as &amp;ldquo;idiot&amp;rdquo; during our conversation ten minutes prior.
To back track, they handed me a pair of parietal bones in the Anatomy Class.</description>

Looking back, why did I seek out going to bars/clubs back then at one point? (and maybe still now?)
In my early years here in Los Angeles, I remember going to bars and clubs. Why did I seek them out? The thrill of finding someone who&amp;rsquo;s into me? The excitement of finding someone who finds me attractive and me attracted back? That age old love story?</description>
