Been talking to this guy, Joey, since morning. I thought he was perfect: face, body, ass. As we were talking throughout the day (i.e., daytime), I bought in to the hope that we would meet up later that night. However, come six o&amp;rsquo;clock evening, Joey bailed and had to go to Walmart. LOL. After that, I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening.</description>

      <title>Be Honest with Yourself! About Emotions!</title>

      <description>In romantic ventures, be honest to yourself about your emotions. Ask, &amp;ldquo;Am I attracted? What does myself need now?&amp;rdquo; Are you even attracted to the person as a whole: looks and personality? @Mad at Myself (again) during Holidays
This situation could have been solved several ways:
  Prevention by asking for face/body pics &amp;ndash; You gotta assess if there&amp;rsquo;s attraction first before making any move.
  Prevention by buying time to assess and decide &amp;ndash; You can meet at a neutral place or go to the bathroom right away.</description>

I was automatically polite towards a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyoneâ€”especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt.</description>
