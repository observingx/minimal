      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th!
I&amp;rsquo;m referring to that person as &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen them as a person first and not by gender, race, or age.Â That person snapped at me a few minutes after hearing me tell my instructor athat I start medical school in 4 months. They snapped. They felt I was referring to them as &amp;ldquo;idiot&amp;rdquo; during our conversation ten minutes prior.
To back track, they handed me a pair of parietal bones in the Anatomy Class.</description>
