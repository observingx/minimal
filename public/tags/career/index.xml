      <description>I officially activaated the &amp;ldquo;Commit to Enroll&amp;rdquo; button on my medical schol portal. It feels surreal. A year ago, I was a hopeful applicant with terrible MCAT. I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful I was given a chance to pursue the medical path and become a physician. All I need now is to just complete paperwork.
Great challenges and growth lie ahead!</description>

Writing date: Friday, 01 Nov 2019
It finally arrived! The phone call acceptance I&amp;rsquo;ve been longing for! I admit, the past 24 hours leading to that phone call was anxiety-inducing. Would I get the call at all? A rejection email perhaps? I even told myself I would be happy if I would be put on hold; anything but a rejection!
I noticed a missed call from a private number.</description>
