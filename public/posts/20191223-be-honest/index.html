<p><img src="/img/beHonest.png" alt="School"></p>
<h2 id="in-romantic-ventures-be-honest-to-yourself-about-your-emotions-ask-am-i-attracted-what-does-myself-need-now">In romantic ventures, be honest to yourself about your emotions. Ask, &ldquo;Am I attracted? What does myself need now?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Are you even attracted to the person as a whole: looks and personality?  @Mad at Myself (again) during Holidays</p>
<p>This situation could have been solved several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prevention by asking for face/body pics &ndash; You gotta assess if there&rsquo;s attraction first before making any move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevention by buying time to assess and decide &ndash; You can meet at a neutral place or go to the bathroom right away. You buy time to help you assess if there&rsquo;s attraction before furthering the move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being honest with oneself  at any moment &ndash; You gotta practice being honest with yourself at any moment and bail if you must, especially when there&rsquo;s not much time involved. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, whatever you <strong>execute</strong> has to put yourself in a <strong>safe space</strong>. You gotta be assertive without being offensive (ideally), but even if you offend the other party it&rsquo;s better for everyone because being romantic with someone has to be truthful.</p>

<p>Event date: Sunday, 22 Dec 2019</p>
<p>Writing date: Monday, 23 Dec 2019 (Early Morning after I got home from that guy&rsquo;s place)</p>
<p>Edited: Sunday, 12 Jul 2020</p>
<p>I met up with Yaro(?) tonight: went straight to his apartment. He lives with other people, so we went to his room right away. I&rsquo;m mad at myself because I went directly to his room, a very intimate confinement, without consulting myself to see if the standards I have have been checked off (this ensures in-person attraction). I should have met up with him at a common place first, and should have known what his personality was like or if I was attracted to him at all. Anyways, when we met, he did not look very much like his photos. The photos on his Grindr were not a very accurate representation of him.</p>
<p>This has happened in the past too. The last time, I met up with a premed neighbor. I had an inkling that I was not into him, but I did not trust my instinct—this decision hurt me. Also, I should have asked for more face and body pics rather than meeting him after 2 pics.</p>
<p>A similar incident in NYC happened too. When I met up with that &ldquo;bi&rdquo; Italian guy in NYC, the problem with that was 2 folds: (1) I did not ask for clear face pics, and (2) I was not candid from the start that I was not into him despite meeting up in a public space first. Though, I was hopeful he had a good body and waited till the winter jackets were off—maybe next time sit inside an even-temperature location where winter jackets would have to be removed?</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s okay to ask for more pics. It&rsquo;s okay to delay meeting up. It&rsquo;s okay to go to the restroom and think about things. It&rsquo;s NOT okay to do things out of social politeness.</p>
<p>Finally, I am mad at myself because I might have ruined my car a little tonight. I accidentally drove over an &ldquo;island&rdquo; on a regular road. It was like driving over a hump with decent speed.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-these-stories-are">The moral of these stories are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be Honest wth Yourself: your emotions, your needs.</li>
<li>You do not have to break anyone&rsquo;s hearts, especially not your own. Hence, be honest with yourself and always convey the whole message: state what I observe, think, feel, and need. </li>
</ul>
