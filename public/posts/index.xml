      <description>I fucked a cute Scandinavian, blond, muscled twink 20-year-old yesterday. What went right:
 Things were clear beforehand: He was into kissing, bottoming, and getting rimmed. Most importantly, he was into kissing. We didn&amp;rsquo;t talk much and just during the act. We just went with the flow.  This was the hottest sex ever to date. This guy was about my height, young, muscly, and good-looking. There was no awkward moment.</description>

      <description>Dude, you&amp;rsquo;ve always known you would want to see a face first. You&amp;rsquo;ve always known you&amp;rsquo;re into kissing? Why not be honest with yourself and save yourself some time, energy, and dignity?
Did you not address those information because you&amp;rsquo;re afraid that the other person might reject you? Furthermore, once you saw the guy in-person, you weren&amp;rsquo;t really into him, so you could fault yourself for compromising what you value.</description>

Been talking to this guy, Joey, since morning. I thought he was perfect: face, body, ass. As we were talking throughout the day (i.e., daytime), I bought in to the hope that we would meet up later that night. However, come six o&amp;rsquo;clock evening, Joey bailed and had to go to Walmart. LOL. After that, I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening.</description>

      <title>Be Honest with Yourself! About Emotions!</title>

      <description>In romantic ventures, be honest to yourself about your emotions. Ask, &amp;ldquo;Am I attracted? What does myself need now?&amp;rdquo; Are you even attracted to the person as a whole: looks and personality? @Mad at Myself (again) during Holidays
This situation could have been solved several ways:
  Prevention by asking for face/body pics &amp;ndash; You gotta assess if there&amp;rsquo;s attraction first before making any move.
  Prevention by buying time to assess and decide &amp;ndash; You can meet at a neutral place or go to the bathroom right away.</description>

I was automatically polite towards a person I was not attracted to over being honest with everyone—especially to myself. I should have asserted to myself, first and foremost, what I truly felt.</description>

It finally arrived! The phone call acceptance I&amp;rsquo;ve been longing for! I admit, the past 24 hours leading to that phone call was anxiety-inducing. Would I get the call at all? A rejection email perhaps? I even told myself I would be happy if I would be put on hold; anything but a rejection!
I noticed a missed call from a private number.</description>
