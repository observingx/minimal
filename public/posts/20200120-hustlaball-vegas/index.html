<h2 id="partyevent-rule-only-go-to-an-event-for-ones-self-if-you-cant-have-fun-alone-its-a-bad-sign-hustlaball-las-vegas">Party/Event Rule: Only go to an event for one&rsquo;s self (If you can&rsquo;t have fun alone, it&rsquo;s a bad sign). @Hustlaball Las Vegas.</h2>
<p>Event date: Sunday, 19 Jan 2020</p>
<p>Writing date: Monday, 20 Jan 2020</p>
<p>I had the option of going to Las Vegas for Hustlaball ($65) or staying in Los Angeles for a free Masterbeat Circuit Party (because of my 2019 purchase). Unfortunately, I chose the former. My reason—well, I thought Hustlaball was &ldquo;the event&rdquo; where everyone was gonna be at (Wow! I can&rsquo;t believe I just said that right now!). If I were to be honest with myself, I really went there because that was &ldquo;where everyone was gonna be.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And I think that was a mistake. One should go to an even for one&rsquo;s self, like to have a good time regardless of whomever else is in attendance. Much like going to the gym, one goes there for one&rsquo;s own sake and not because to be part of a conglomerate, to be loved/liked, or to be given attention to. I personally go to the gym and have fun even if it was just me.</p>
<p>Thus, I took a bus ride at 5PM on a Sunday night from LA, arrived in Vegas at 10:30PM in time for the party, and I left Las Vegas at 5AM Monday morning. Hindsight is 20/20, and I admit this was a sub-par experience.</p>
<p>On a different note, I was lucky enough that the drivers of my bus rides let me in without  a ticket because I could not purchase them online. And I definitnely tried to sleep on the 5 hour bus ride from Vegas to LA.</p>
<p>What would have made Hustlaball over Masterbeat a good decision?</p>
<ul>
<li>If I was in Vegas already, it would have made sense for Hustlaball.</li>
<li>If I knew what kind of attendees were there, it would have made sense to not go there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hustlaball-las-vegas">Hustlaball Las Vegas</h2>
<p>You see, Hustlaball Las Vegas was like a hybrid between a bathhouse and  a circuit party. However, its circuit party atmosphere was 5x worse than a regular circuit party (bad sound system and bad dance floor for starters, after all, they made a club out of a hotel&rsquo;s dining area), but its bathhouse atmosphere is 2x better than regular bathhouses. Then, there&rsquo;s a sprinkle of hired porn actors to be go-go dancers or perhaps to get hanky-panky with the customers. 
As you may know, a bathhouse has all sorts of guys wherein more than 90% of guys I  wouldn&rsquo;t dare touch, especially if the lights on. Same thing was the case at this Hustlaball Vegas. </p>
<p>To make things worse, more than a third of attendees/customers were clothed older men. Since I was wearing nothing but a swimsuit, it definitely felt like it was a one-way observation from those who were clothed. At a circuit party, everyone was shirtless. </p>
<p>It was also easy to be mesmerized by porn actors. Remember the psychology principle on familiarity and attraction: &ldquo;Studies have shown that we are attracted to what is familiar to us, and that repeated exposure to certain people will increase our attraction toward them.&rdquo; It was in play here with the hired porn actor. When you see a familiar porn star face, you easily gravitate towards them.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-learned">Lesson learned:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Party/Event Rule:</strong> Only go to an event for one&rsquo;s self. If you can&rsquo;t have fun alone, don&rsquo;t go. Much like going to the gym, you go there for your own sake. Not because to be part of a conglomerate, to be loved/liked, or to be given attention to. You go there and have fun even if it was just you by yourself.</li>
<li>And if there are multiple events, compare their logistics (energy expenditure, cost, distance, expected kinds of attendees).</li>
